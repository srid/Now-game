# Now
Now is a game where success is measured using your concentration.

# Status
I just started working on this project; early stages.

# Key ideas
- Uses brain scanner to detect concentration levels
- When concentration goes down, visibility becomes fuzzy
- Concentrate again to re-gain visibility
- Goal: lead your wiggling bot along the narrow pathway

# Technology
- Haskell: server-side, and for receiving OSC stream from Muse headset
- Elm: client-side game engine and renderer
- muse-io: from Muse SDK (may run on a different machine)
